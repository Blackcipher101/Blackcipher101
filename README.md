# Hi there! I'm Nehal 👋
## About Me 🧑‍💼
I'm currently a Head of Planning and Prediction at Minus Zero, working towards accelerating the world's transition to autonomous mobility. 🚗
I have a background in both Schrödinger's states and cognitive computation, and have found similarities between multi-verse and multi-tasking. 🤔
Prior to my current role, I worked as a Research Engineer in Autonomy at Minus Zero, where I joined as one of the first team members to solve some of the most challenging problem statements. 🔬
I have also completed an internship as a Computer Vision Intern at Clutterbot, where I worked with a New Zealand client on localising bins and reducing build time. 🤖
I enjoy working on challenging problems and using my skills to make a positive impact. 💪
