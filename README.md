# Hi there! I'm Nehal 👋
## About Me 🧑‍💼
As the Head of Planning and Prediction at Minus Zero, I'm working towards accelerating the world's transition to autonomous mobility. It's an exciting challenge, and I bring a unique perspective to the table thanks to my background in both Schrödinger's states and cognitive computation.

Before taking on my current role, I worked as a Research Engineer in Autonomy at Minus Zero, where I joined as one of the first team members. It was a thrilling experience to work on some of the most challenging problem statements related to developing and implementing algorithms and systems for autonomous vehicles. This involved working with data from lidar or cameras and developing machine learning models to interpret that data and make decisions about how the vehicle should navigate. I also had the opportunity to test and refine these systems to ensure they functioned accurately and reliably.

My internship as a Computer Vision Intern at Clutterbot was another valuable experience that gave me hands-on experience in developing computer vision algorithms to detect and localize objects in images or video data. Working with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch and using tools like OpenCV for image processing gave me a solid foundation in this field. During this internship, I also had the chance to work with a New Zealand client on localizing bins and reducing build time, which taught me valuable skills in working with clients or stakeholders to understand their needs and develop solutions that meet their requirements.

Overall, my diverse experiences have prepared me well for my current role at Minus Zero. I'm excited to use my skills and knowledge to help accelerate the transition to autonomous mobility and make transportation safer and more efficient for everyone.
